# R3F application debug

## React application debug

    StrictMode in React helps to warn us about potential problems like
        1. Unused imports.
        2. Infinite render loop.
        3. Forgotten useEffect dependencies.
        4. Deprecated practices.
        5. etc
    In /src/index.js, import StrictMode from react
    import {StrictMode} from 'react';

    StrictMode will be ignored once the application is built
